## Marinara-Translation-Tools 1.5.4

`src/presets/upstream/*` and `src/presets/catalog.ts` are copied verbatim, and `src/translate/prompt.ts` ports the request-building logic, from
[minikkeuen/Marinara-Translation-Tools](https://github.com/minikkeuen/Marinara-Translation-Tools) 1.5.4 (`extension.js`, `prompts/*.js`). `src/presets/upstream/prompt-fingerprints.json` is the upstream `tests/prompt-fingerprints.json`.

## Marinara Engine

[Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine](https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine), licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). This extension follows the behaviour of its chat translation feature and reuses two short pieces of its text:

- The default translation prompt sentence ("You are a translator. Translate the given text accurately into {{targetLanguage}}, …"), used as `BASE_PROMPT` from `src/presets/upstream/general.ts`. The same sentence is also part of Marinara-Translation-Tools 1.5.4 `prompts/general.js` (MIT, above), from which that file is copied.
- The user message wording "Translate the following text to <language>:" in `src/translate/prompt.ts`.

## Paragraph Reader 0.2.0

The paragraph split, the no-text paragraph check, the HTML block grouping (`src/translate/paragraphs.ts`) and the paragraph view design come from Paragraph Reader 0.2.0, written by the owner of this repository.

## RP 번역표시 설정 확장 1.0.2 (Marinara 개인 확장)

The excluded-tag list in `src/translate/protect.ts` (`parseTags`, `protectElements`: skipping comments and code, counting same-name nesting, void-tag list, keeping `strong`/`em`) and the choice of display modes in 0.2.0 follow "RP 번역표시 설정 확장" 1.0.2, a Marinara personal extension posted on the DCinside aifrontend mini gallery: https://gall.dcinside.com/mini/board/view/?id=aifrontend&no=4375. The code was adapted for Lumiverse (the tag-scanning regular expression is reused; the rest is rewritten). The post states "수정 재공유 자유" (free to modify and re-share); no separate license file came with it. That extension is not ours and its author keeps whatever rights they have.
